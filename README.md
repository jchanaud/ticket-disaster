## Welcome to Kafka CTF!

In this challenge, you simply need to produce a message to Kafka with a ticket request id and wait one hour.  

Unfortunately, the DevOps (or should we say DevOOPS) has mistakenly left the ChaosMonkeyService ðŸ™Š enabled in Production.

As a result, all tickets disappear every 15 minutes!

## Objective
Browse the webapp and check the source code to figure out how to get to the flag.  
Format of the flag: `flag{xxxxx}`
